The Flexiv Omni Teleop SDK provides C++ APIs for developing complex and customized applications involving robot-robot or device-robot teleoperation. The supported devices are listed below.

## Supported devices

| **Supported teleop type** | **Supported local machine** | **Supported remote machine** |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| robot-robot               | Rizon4s                     | Rizon4s                      |

## Compatibility

| **Supported OS**     | **Supported processor** | **Supported language** | **Required compiler kit** |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) | x86_64                  | C++                    | build-essential           |

### Applying for Omni license
1. The Omni certificate is forcibly bound to the user's Ubuntu computer hardware, so before proceeding with the following steps, make sure you have prepared a physical computer with Ubuntu 22.04 and CPU platform x86_64. If you need CPUs compatible with other operating systems or architectures, please contact flexiv
2. Run the generator to generate your feature ID and provide the feature id to apply for the license.
Note: The feature id is a unique identifier for your application and is bound to your local computer. Please generate feature ID and use license on the same computer.

### Compile and install for Linux

1. In a new Terminal, install C++ compiler, Git, and CMake (with GUI) using the package manager:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev git cmake cmake-qt-gui -y
   ```
2. Choose a directory for installing ``flexiv_omni_teleop`` library and all its dependencies. For example, a new folder named ``teleop_install`` under the home directory.
3. Please ensure that your network connection is unobstructed. Then, in a new Terminal, run the provided script to compile and install all dependencies to the installation directory chosen in step 2:

   ```bash
   cd flexiv_omni_teleop/thirdparty
   bash build_and_install_dependencies.sh ~/teleop_install
   ```
4. In a new Terminal, use CMake to configure `flexiv_omni_teleop`:

   ```bash
   cd flexiv_omni_teleop
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/teleop_install
   ```
   NOTE: ``-D`` followed by ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is a CMake parameter specifying the path of the chosen installation directory. Alternatively, this configuration step can also be done through CMake GUI.
5. Compile and install `flexiv_omni_teleop` library:

   ```bash
   cd flexiv_omni_teleop/build
   cmake --build . --target install --config Release
   ```
   NOTE: the installation of `flexiv_omni_teleop` library is complete now. The following steps show how to link to the installed library from a user project.
### Link to the installed library to a user project
1. To find and link to the installed `flexiv_omni_teleop` library to a user project, using the provided example project for instance:

   ```bash
   cd flexiv_omni_teleop/example
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/teleop_install
   cmake --build . --config Release -j 4
   ```
   NOTE: ``-D`` followed by ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` tells user project's CMake where to find the installed `flexiv_omni_teleop` library.
2. Set all the robots were in `Auto/Remote Mode` via flexiv Elements, then to run the compiled example program
